## SolX

This was the source code for SolX's website (a local solar installation company). It was hosted on Heroku but has since been migrated to Squarespace to give the client more control over the site. 

* **Front end**: was designed in Photoshop and built using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery and AJAX. It incorporates responsive design features. 

* **Back end**: uses a node.js stack with express and nodemailer. 

*Made in collaboration with @nguyenmdan*
