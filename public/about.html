Savings on electricity recoups the remaining 20% in 5-8 years on most projects. Here is how it works.</p>

					<p><span class="pgh-heading-black">1) 30% Federal Tax Credit: If you have a tax liability, you can reduce or have refunded 30% of the installed cost. </span><br>
For example, if you pay $25,000.00 including sales tax for solar on your roof, you would receive $7,500.00 off your taxes when you go to file with the IRS at the end of the year. If you already paid the $7,500.00 in, you would get that amount refunded. But, if you had no tax liability for the year, you would get no credit at all. If your liability is less than $7500.00, you would carry forward the difference to future years until exhausted.</p>

				<p><span class="pgh-heading-black">2) 50% Subsidy through the Washington State Renewable Energy Payment program.</span><br>
The State started a new program in 2017 that pays you 16 to 21 cents per KWH produced from solar for 8 full years, or 50% of the installed cost, whichever comes first. The program requires a copy of the final installer invoice so it can verify what that 50% is. Panels manufactured in the State of Washington qualify for the 21 cents per KWH rate, while those manufactured outside of the state qualify for 16 cents per KWH. Usually, 50% of the installed cost will be defeated in about 6.5 years. So, you don’t really get 8 full years of payments. But, it’s hard to complain the state is capping your payments in year 6 when it just paid for half the entire installation cost.</p>

					<p><span class="pgh-heading-black">3) Savings on Electricity You Would Otherwise Pay.</span><br>

There is a 3rd program that pays you indefinitely for the solar you produce. This is called Net Metering. Solar from the panels will first be used by your home. In the summer when you are producing more electricity than you are using, the 
meter will spin backward as that electricity is being sent down the street to your neighbor’s home. Your utility bill will begin to build up a credit. This credit rolls over month to month into the darker winter months when you will pull from that credit. So, it is a sharing arrangement with the utility and you get a credit for the full residential rate. Technically, they don’t actually pay you for the electricity (rather your bill is reduced). In April, if you have a credit, your meter is set back to zero and you lose that credit. This might seem like a bad deal, but typically most customers have used up their credits by the time April rolls around, or are very close to zero. I do have customers whose entire electric bill is defeated each month (except the monthly billing fee).</p>

		<p class="pgh-heading-centered"><span class="pgh-heading">The Future of Solar & Electricity</span></p>

<p>It’s possible a form of free energy will be developed in the near future, which would mean an investment in solar would be wasted. But, that seems unlikely. More likely is an increased demand on the energy grid and higher electric rates.  I’m not just anticipating an increase in population, which will happen. Rather, the main driver will be electric cars. The Prius and Tesla vehicles forged the way, but many other manufacturers are coming in quickly with reasonably priced electric vehicles. For instance, Hyundai has a new EV for under $25,000.00 with a 120-mile range. When drivers plug in at home, this will burden the electric grid and cause costs to spike. That’s what Solx predicts. The cost of electricity is still pennies on the dollar compared to traditional fuel, but electric rates will rise quickly. Customers with solar should be grinning ear to ear considering Federal and State programs pay for 80% of the installed cost and a savings on electricity kicked in the remainder over just 6-7 years. Well, maybe there is free energy…called solar (subsidized yes, but free in a sense).</p><p><span class="pgh-heading-black">Will the program run out of money?</span> Yes. It will. But, unlike prior programs that reduced the incentive amount to all participants in the program, this new legislation closes the program to new participants when the monies are fully allocated. So, once a homeowner is certified, they are locked in to the program at the full amount guaranteed (for 8 years or 50% of the installation cost, whichever comes first)</p>

<p><span class="pgh-heading-black">What about battery backup?</span> We liken battery backup to having a home gas generator. The cost is about the same either way after factoring in the 30% federal tax credit, which also applies to solar battery systems. Figure, a gas generator is 
about $6700.00 including sales tax. A battery backup system is about $9,000.00, but drops to about $6700.00 (after tax) once applying the 30% federal tax credit. LG has come out with a 10 KWH Lithium Ion battery that works with a StorEdge inverter from Solar Edge. The inverter costs a little more than the standard inverter, and requires an auto transformer and critical loads panel to work. We supply and wire both of those. The battery will power a refrigerator, a couple circuits with lights on them, some outlets, TV, furnace thermostat, computer, router, and a couple other circuits. Not bad. When the power goes out, you will be in comfort.</p>

				<p class="pgh-heading-centered"><span class="pgh-heading">Internet Monitoring</span><br></p>

				<p>All solar installations have the option of internet monitoring. The best systems will show the production of each individual solar panel. Other systems show only the aggregate electricity produced by a string of 10-14 panels in series. We try to coach homeowners toward the systems that monitor panels individually. We don’t have to troubleshoot often, but when it does happen, this sort of monitoring eliminates a lot of questions quickly. It is very nice to simply log into a website and see how the solar is doing. There is always a historical log that keeps data back to the inception date.</p>

		<div class="faq-body">
			

			<div class="faq-text">
	<div class="faq-one"><span class="pgh-heading">Why would you match a 280 watt solar panel with a micro-inverter that can only output 250 watts?</span><br>
<p>Each of the two inputs on the APS/Blue Frog micro-inverter are designed to accept up to 305 watts DC input, but will only output 250 watts AC. If there were a combined conversion/line loss of about 15%, the micro-inverter should be able to handle a 295 watt panel without clipping off any significant wattage (since 295 watts minus 15% or 44.25 watts = 250.75 watts).</p>

<p>However, the truth is that there are at least a few moments during the course of a year where there might be little more than a 5% loss. In this instance, a 295 watt module would be pumping 280 watts into a inverter that can theoretically only output 250 watts. In this case, 30 watts would be getting clipped off. It wouldn't hurt the inverter, but raises a question about system design. Would it have been better to install modules with a lower wattage rating (like 260 watt modules)?</p>

<p>It has been theorized by inverter manufactures that an array owner would be better to have 280 watt modules producing all year and clipping a few times during the season, than to have 260 watt modules never clipping, but producing less wattage each all year long. But this is the sort of thing you can expect an inverter manufacturer to say. Ultimately, it comes down to available roof space. If there is limitted space and you are trying to get as many modules as possible on the roof, you would probably do better to have higher wattage per panel and accept some clipping a couple hours a day on some of the sunniest days of the year. However, if you have plenty of roof space and can accomodate over 36 modules, you might be better to choose the lower wattage modules and never have clipping.</p></div>

<div class="vertical-line"></div>

	<div class="faq-two"><span class="pgh-heading">What is the difference between line inverters and micro-inverters?</span><br>
<p>The short answer is that micro-Inverters handle shade and clouds better, but are more expensive. Here is the long version.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of a solar project hinges on the availability of direct sunlight. Indirect sunlight will produce some minimal results, but real production occurs in direct sunlight. So, our measurements are done with a tool that records and calculates "solar access."  For a home that has clear access with no significant shading, we will typically steer the customer toward a line inverter since it is cheaper. Line inverters are mounted near the electrical panel and conduit is run up to the roof to connect to the solar panels.</p>

<p>However, usually there is a tree or other obstruction that interferes with the sun. If there were "block" shading in the morning or evening, we may still suggest a line inverter. However, if we encounter a scenario where there is "intermittant" shading, we will suggest micro-inverters. This is because shading on a single part of a solar panel will not only reduce the output of that panel, but the output of all modules attached to that panel to that of the lowest performing panel. In a 36 panel installation you would have 3 strings of 12 modules. Thus, shade on one panel in a string of 12 will affect all 12, or 33% of the entire array. If you were to have a tree shade portions of string of panels in the morning with another taking over in the afternoon, and another in the late day, theoretically, one or more strings could suffer reduced ouput the entire day even though only one panel at a time was shaded.</p>

<p>Micro-inverters solve this problem. They allow each module to act independently of the others. Thus, shading on a single panel only effects that panel and none others. This is why we use alot of micro-inverters in Bellevue, the Eastside, and Seattle. APS/Blue Frog micro-inverters mount up underneath the modules. There is one micro-inverter for every two panels.</p>

<p>Micro-inverters have the added benefit of providing monitoring that breaks down production for each individual panel in near real time. Alternately, line inverters only have the capacity to break production down per string (8-13 modules).  Both types of inverters allow for internet monitoring. With micro-inverters it is usually included in the quoted system price automatically. With line inverters, internet monitoring is an optional add-on.</p>
