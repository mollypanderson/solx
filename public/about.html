					<p><span class="pgh-heading">SolX Corp</span>
in Sammamish, WA is a solar installation company. We sell solar systems priced as a turn-key package. After a no-cost consultation, we give you pricing that includes panels, inverters, wiring, permits, labor, program enrollment forms sent to various agencies, and anything necessary to make solar work at your home.</p>

<p>We take extreme pride in doing quality work. You will be impressed by our single minded devotion to your project. This installation will last 30+ years. Every nut, bolt, and wire is carefully thought-out in advance. We know homeowners want 1) high quality components, 2) aesthetically pleasing solar, and 3) the quickest payback possible. We use our knowledge and experience to design arrays that meet those goals. With recent shifts in local incentive programs, we find using out-of-state products sometimes results in a more favorable return on investment than in-state products, so we typically present different options so you have choices.</p>

<p>Let us know your preferences, so we can put together a customized design. With SolX, you have nearly 24 hour access to solar consultants to walk you through any questions you have from your initial inquiry to flipping the final breaker after installation.</p>

				<p class="benefitting"><span class="pgh-heading">Benefitting from Solar Energy</span><br>SolX Corp installs solar array panels for clients in Sammamish, the Eastside, and Seattle. We know that many homeowners install solar for reasons other than mere financial gain. However, we also recognize the same people who value social responsibility typically prize fiscal responsibility as well. Thus, it is important to understand the role government incentives play in the solar equation. The following attempts to address the changing landscape of these incentives. This page is still under construction.</p>

					<p><span class="pgh-heading">Stream #1- 30% Federal Tax Credit</span><br>
A dollar for dollar tax credit is available for 30% of the installation cost. This is not a deduction. It a legitimate credit. However, it is not refundable. This means you must actually have a tax liability for the year to take the credit. Amounts that exceed your tax liability can be carried forward to future years until exhausted.</p>
<p>
So, lets say you paid $30,000.00 for a solar installation. Your tax credit would be $9,000.00. If your tax liability for the year totaled $7,000.00, you could take the $7,000.00 as a credit, reduce your tax liability to zero for the year, and get a refund of any amounts you paid in or had witheld from your paychecks. Yet, there would be a $2,000.00 credit remaining that would be carried over to remaining years until used up.</p>

				<p><span class="pgh-heading">Stream #2- Savings on Electricity You Would Otherwise Pay For</span><br>
Presumably, everyone uses some electricity. With solar, the electricity you use is shared with the grid when you enter into an interconnection agreement with the utility provider. When you overproduce electricity, the unused portion is fed into the grid for your neighbor to use. When you underproduce, you draw from the grid. It is common to overproduce during the summer and underproduce during the winter. Credits from overproduction carry forward from month to month until April 1st. At that point, the meter is set back to zero and the agreement states that you will essentially grant the credit to the utility without reimbursement.</p>

<p>Some utilities such as Puget Sound Energy and Seattle City Light have two tier billing structures. PSE charges a lower rate for the first 600 KWH of electricty and a higher rate for anything over that. Typically, we will analyze your utility bill to figure out what your average rate is between those two tiers based on your usage. If you use alot of electricity, your average rate will be higher. If you use less electricity, you may always be charged at the lower tier. However, it is important to note that solar first eliminates charges from the higher tier usage before eliminating the cheaper electricity.</p>

					<p><span class="pgh-heading">Stream #3- State of Washington Production Incentive Payment</span><br>

Through June of 2020, the State of Washington has a program that pays you an additional incentive for the solar electricity you produce. This is completely separate from stream #2. It is essentially a grant, giveaway, freebie, etc. To make it confusing, the state doesn't pay you directly. It actually comes in the form of an anual check from your utility provider. They receive a tax credit against sales tax they would otherwise forward to the State of Washington collected from their customers. A second meter is installed near your existing meter that records every watt of electricity generated from your solar.</p>

<p>So, the language of the applicable legislation provides 54 cents per KWH if you have solar panels and inverters installed that were manufactured in the State of Washington. It is 15 cents per KWH for out-of-state manufactured products. However, it is worth noting there is only 1 manufacturer of solar panels in the State of Washington that solar installer purchase from. This one company essentially has a monopoly on the market and the cost of their product is significantly more expensive than competitors. Thus, an installed system using in-state products can easily cost $10,000 more than an equivalent system using out-of-state products.</p>

		<p>So, this raises the question as to whether it is cheaper to pay less for an out-of-state system and receive a lower incentive rate, or rather pay more for the in-state products and reap a larger incentive rate. Last year, everytime we did the math, it was cheaper to use the in-state products...or so we thought.</p>

<p>There was always one little caveat included in the fine print of legislation and the solar contracts all installer received from their customers. This term caps the incentive payments to 1/2 of 1% of the electric sales of the utility provider. Well, in prior years, the cap had never been reached. But, last year alone saw 3 times as much solar installed than the prior year. That combined with exceptional weather resulted in both Puget Sound Energy and Seattle City Light hitting the cap. PSE shaved 20% off thier incentive rate for in-state products dropping the rate from 54 cents to 43.2 cents. Seattle City Light last predicted a rate just under 40 cents. Moreover, we can expect to see further rate drops each consecutive year until the program ends in June of 2020 unless the cap is raised or the program modified.</p>

<p>However, for out-of-state products, the PSE rate only dropped from 15 cents to 12 cents. This is significant in that now out-of-state manufactured systems have a shorter payback. When we run the numbers, we assume annual rate drops of 20% year over year through the end of the program. Of course, we can only guess at what will really happen, but this is our best guess.</p>

<p>So, you can hedge your bet with out-of-state products quite nicely. Another benefit of using out-of-state products is that they give you more choices for equipment. I could tell you what these choices are, but that could tip off the competition. We do have some very nice options available that inexpensively make your system more enjoyable. A free solar analysis is just a phone call away. 1-877-797-7556.</p>

<p>It is possible the state legislature could modify and extend the program. We thought this would happen last year, but the proposed bill never passed. There is a bill working its way through the legislature right now that seems very promising suggesting new program enrollees may have an option to extend their production incentive payments for a 10-year term. We have run the numbers for out-of-state systems versus in-state and the difference is dramatic with very favorable payback periods and additional payments from the state after systems are paid for. However, nothing is certain and everything at this point is conjecture and speculation.</p>

<p>Washington State does have a history of extending its solar programs and raising the market caps. The cap was at 1/4 of 1%, but was previously raised to 1/2 of 1%. The program was set to expire in 2018, but was extended to 2020. There are people who got in early that have systems already paid for through incentives that continue to receive incentive payments.</p>

Some utilities have a rebate that is offered in addition to these other streams of revenue. The Snohomish County PUD offers a one-time $2,000.00 rebate for solar installations through the Solar Express program. However, the language of the program requires you to sign away your potential REC's for the rebate.</p>

<div class="incentives-two">
				<p><span class="pgh-heading">Possible Stream #5-Renewable Energy Credits (REC's)</span><br>

				The East Coast has programs that allow residential customers to sell the rights to green energy produced from their solar to companies that would purchase these rights without affecting your compensation from any of the other streams of revenue. In fact, the Bonneville Power Administration recently had a program stating it would pay 10 cents per KWH for Green Tags from residential solar. This program has been discontinued. However, at 10 cents per KWH, a 35 panel system producing 10,000 KWH per year would receive $5,000.00 over a 5-year period, which is a much better deal than a $2,000.00 utility rebate. It is not clear if a market place for green tags will emerge in Washington State or not. If it does, this will be a huge deal as it could mean 30-40 years of Green Tag income alone. Solar panels power production is typically warranteed to produce 80% or more of its initial power production after 25 years, but we know of systems in Olympia that are still functioning that were installed in the 70's. Yet, we believe production techniques have only improved</p>

Who likes getting pumped for gas? Tesla owners clearly don't. As a Sammamish resident, I think I probably see a higher ratio of Tesla cars being driven than might exist in Burien due to being in a tech centered demographic. But, I can't be sure since I haven't been to Burien lately. Today, as I drove past Costco by the Brown Bear car wash, I saw two white Tesla Model S's back to back.</p>

<div><a>Electric cars and hybrids have become extremely popular and it is certain to continue despite the recent dip in oil prices. The cost of electriciy is pennies on the dollar compared to gas, but on some electric vehicles you may pay a premium for the vehicle. However, it is important to note that your additional use of electricity to charge the vehicle will likely put you well into the higher tiered electric rates from your utility provider. You would think there would be an exemption for driving an electric vehicle, but that doesn't exist to date.</a>

<p>There is no doubt electric cars are the wave of the future. Lacking an engine, they require far lower maintenance and you don't have to worry about exhaust leaking into your driver's compartment. Prices are going to drop over time. If you already have solar installed and paid for through the incentive program, you will essentially be getting the equivalent of free gas. However, the state legislature has already indicated they will phase the program out over time as they expect solar to become self sustaining in 10 to 15 years. If you lock in now, you are grandfathered into the incentive program (subject to its terms).</p></div>

			<div class="faq-text">
	<div class="faq-one"><span class="pgh-heading">Why would you match a 280 watt solar panel with a micro-inverter that can only output 250 watts?</span><br>
<p>Each of the two inputs on the APS/Blue Frog micro-inverter are designed to accept up to 305 watts DC input, but will only output 250 watts AC. If there were a combined conversion/line loss of about 15%, the micro-inverter should be able to handle a 295 watt panel without clipping off any significant wattage (since 295 watts minus 15% or 44.25 watts = 250.75 watts).</p>

<p>However, the truth is that there are at least a few moments during the course of a year where there might be little more than a 5% loss. In this instance, a 295 watt module would be pumping 280 watts into a inverter that can theoretically only output 250 watts. In this case, 30 watts would be getting clipped off. It wouldn't hurt the inverter, but raises a question about system design. Would it have been better to install modules with a lower wattage rating (like 260 watt modules)?</p>

<p>It has been theorized by inverter manufactures that an array owner would be better to have 280 watt modules producing all year and clipping a few times during the season, than to have 260 watt modules never clipping, but producing less wattage each all year long. But this is the sort of thing you can expect an inverter manufacturer to say. Ultimately, it comes down to available roof space. If there is limitted space and you are trying to get as many modules as possible on the roof, you would probably do better to have higher wattage per panel and accept some clipping a couple hours a day on some of the sunniest days of the year. However, if you have plenty of roof space and can accomodate over 36 modules, you might be better to choose the lower wattage modules and never have clipping.</p></div>

<div class="vertical-line"></div>

	<div class="faq-two"><span class="pgh-heading">What is the difference between line inverters and micro-inverters?</span><br>
<p>The short answer is that micro-Inverters handle shade and clouds better, but are more expensive. Here is the long version.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of a solar project hinges on the availability of direct sunlight. Indirect sunlight will produce some minimal results, but real production occurs in direct sunlight. So, our measurements are done with a tool that records and calculates "solar access."  For a home that has clear access with no significant shading, we will typically steer the customer toward a line inverter since it is cheaper. Line inverters are mounted near the electrical panel and conduit is run up to the roof to connect to the solar panels.</p>

<p>However, usually there is a tree or other obstruction that interferes with the sun. If there were "block" shading in the morning or evening, we may still suggest a line inverter. However, if we encounter a scenario where there is "intermittant" shading, we will suggest micro-inverters. This is because shading on a single part of a solar panel will not only reduce the output of that panel, but the output of all modules attached to that panel to that of the lowest performing panel. In a 36 panel installation you would have 3 strings of 12 modules. Thus, shade on one panel in a string of 12 will affect all 12, or 33% of the entire array. If you were to have a tree shade portions of string of panels in the morning with another taking over in the afternoon, and another in the late day, theoretically, one or more strings could suffer reduced ouput the entire day even though only one panel at a time was shaded.</p>

<p>Micro-inverters solve this problem. They allow each module to act independently of the others. Thus, shading on a single panel only effects that panel and none others. This is why we use alot of micro-inverters in Bellevue, the Eastside, and Seattle. APS/Blue Frog micro-inverters mount up underneath the modules. There is one micro-inverter for every two panels.</p>

<p>Micro-inverters have the added benefit of providing monitoring that breaks down production for each individual panel in near real time. Alternately, line inverters only have the capacity to break production down per string (8-13 modules).  Both types of inverters allow for internet monitoring. With micro-inverters it is usually included in the quoted system price automatically. With line inverters, internet monitoring is an optional add-on.</p>
