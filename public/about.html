                        in Sammamish, WA is a Solar Installation company, Roofing Company, Licensed Electrical
                        Contractor, and General Construction Contractor. Because solar installation involves a variety
                        of trades, we have the skills and experience to perform different types of construction. In our
                        gallery, you will see mostly solar installations, but will also find framing, concrete, finish
                        work, household electrical wiring, and home remodels. We take extreme pride in doing quality
                        work. Currently we are focusing on solar and home electrical, but other work is not out of the question. </p>

                            For example, if you pay $25,000.00 including sales tax for solar on your roof, you would
                            receive $6,500.00 off your taxes when you go to file with the IRS at the end of the year. If
                            you already paid the $6,500.00 in, you would get that amount refunded. But, if you had no
                            tax liability for the year, you would get no credit at all. If your liability is less than
                            $6500.00, you would carry forward the difference to future years until exhausted.</p>

                    This program has allocated all available funds to existing solar applicants. It is not known if new funds will be allocated
                    as it would require an act of the state congress. Some utilities including PSE have opted out of the incentive program and no longer show as
                    participants in the drop-down list in the online application to be waitlisted. The original intent of the incentive program was to initially
                    subsidize solar until costs drop to the point where subsidies were unnecessary. We may have reached that point. Costs have dropped dramatically
                    over the last couple years and our company remains very busy despite the apparent end to the state incentive. Note also, solar is sales tax
                    exempt now, which was not the case last year while incentives were available. </p>

                            There is a 3rd program that pays you indefinitely for the solar you produce. This is called
                            Net Metering. Solar from the panels will first be used by your home. In the summer when you
                            are producing more electricity than you are using, the
                            meter will spin backward as that electricity is being sent down the street to your
                            neighbor’s home. Your utility bill will begin to build up a credit. This credit rolls over
                            month to month into the darker winter months when you will pull from that credit. So, it is
                            a sharing arrangement with the utility and you get a credit for the full residential rate.
                            Technically, they don’t actually pay you for the electricity (rather your bill is reduced).
                            In March, if you have a credit, your meter is set back to zero and you lose that credit.
                            This might seem like a bad deal, but typically most customers have used up their credits by
                            the time April rolls around, or are very close to zero. We do have customers whose entire
                            electric bill is defeated each month (except the monthly billing fee).</p>

                    </p>

                    <p>It’s possible a form of free energy will be developed in the future, which would mean an
                        investment in solar would be wasted. But, that seems unlikely. More likely is an increased
                        demand on the energy grid and higher electric rates. I’m not just anticipating an increase in
                        population, which will happen. Rather, the main driver will be electric cars. The Prius and
                        Tesla vehicles forged the way, but many other manufacturers are coming in quickly with
                        reasonably priced electric vehicles. When drivers plug in at home, this will burden the electric grid and
                        cause costs to spike. That’s what Solx predicts. The cost of electricity is still pennies on the
                        dollar compared to traditional fuel, but electric rates could rise quickly.</p>

                            <p><span class="pgh-heading-black">What about battery backup?</span> We liken battery backup
                                to having a home gas generator. The cost is about the same either way after factoring in
                                the 26% federal tax credit, which also applies to solar battery systems. Figure, a gas
                                generator is
                                about $7500.00 including sales tax. A battery backup system is about $10,000.00, but
                                drops to about $7500.00 (after tax) once applying the 26% federal tax credit. LG has
                                come out with a 10 KWH Lithium Ion battery that works with a StorEdge inverter from
                                Solar Edge. The inverter costs a little more than the standard inverter, and requires an
                                auto transformer and critical loads panel to work. We supply and wire both of those. The
                                battery will power a refrigerator, a couple circuits with lights on them, some outlets,
                                TV, furnace thermostat, computer, router, and a couple other circuits. Not bad. When the
                                power goes out, you will be in comfort.</p>

                        <p>All solar installations have the option of internet monitoring. The best systems will show
                            the production of each individual solar panel. Other systems show only the aggregate
                            electricity produced by a string of 10-14 panels in series. We try to coach homeowners
                            toward the systems that monitor panels individually. We don’t have to troubleshoot often,
                            but when it does happen, this sort of monitoring eliminates a lot of questions quickly. It
                            is very nice to simply log into a website and see how the solar is doing. There is always a
                            historical log that keeps data back to the inception date.</p>
