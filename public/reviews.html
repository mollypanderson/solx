“We started researching solar power over a year ago. When the time came to pull the trigger we started researching installers, including one at a presentation and two more we met at the Seattle Home Show. SolX came into the mix via a recommendation from HomeAdvisor. Only two of the four actually went on the roof, including Steve from SolX. The first contractor we eliminated was over twice the cost of any of the others. Another never got back to us after the original salesman/inspector left the company. Steve eventually won the contract with a combination of the best pricing, his willingness to spend as much time as needed to discuss the project with us and his attention to detail, including showing us several options for size, power production, and return on investment. He also sent multiple follow-up emails with updates from the state government on solar subsidies. During the panel installation Steve kept us updated daily, performed daily clean-up, and assisted with all paperwork needed for PSE. His attention to customer service was very welcome and appreciated.”<br><div class="signature"><span class="bold-link">- Michael B.</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bothell, WA</div>

It's hard to describe how large it is until friends and family see it. It's on a pad 29 x 20, and the cover is 26 x20. It's better then what we were hoping for and have had a couple of Events all ready. This summer is going to be FUN. Thanks again Stephen.

He was very attentive in addressing my concerns related to ventilation of the attic (installing ridge venting) and proactive in troubleshooting areas where I had expressed concern of water infiltration (around the chimney and porch overhang).  Steve was also extremely patient and flexible as I changed my mind last minute on the roof tiles.  Roof looks great, and I highly recommend SolX for future roof replacement.”<br><div class="signature">- <span class="bold-link">Michelle A.</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ballard, WA</div>

They were professional, maintained the budget and completed the work in a timely manner. We have had the system running for about 4 months and things are working well. Fortunately this year has been unseasonably sunny so we are getting the benefits during a period we were not expecting. I would recommend them for solar projects.”

I do not usually write reviews, but in this case I am compelled to say how good my experience was with Solx. Steve did an excellent job educating me on all the options and went through several iterations calculating ROI under different programs to help me come up with the best solution. The project got complicated by my electrical system that needed to be upgraded. They went out of their way to upgrade my electrical at cost to accommodate the new set up (this upgrade of my overall electrical system to enable me to make other improvements as well). He has coached me through and completed the paperwork for all the subsidies and incentive programs. Months later I found shingles around the yard and asked him about them, he came out, checked the roof, did some repairs instantly. Steve goes so far beyond expectations in his level of service, I can't recommend him enough.” (Review from <a href="https://www.angieslist.com/companylist/us/wa/sammamish/solx-corp-reviews-8771191.htm">Angie's list</a>) <br><div class="signature">- <span class="bold-link">Steve C.</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Lake, Seattle, WA
